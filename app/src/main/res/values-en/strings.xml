    <!-- Sala Histórica Eras -->
    <string name="era0_titulo">The Origins</string>
    <string name="era0_periodo">1902 - 1940</string>
    <string name="era0_info_corta">Club foundation and first crest.</string>
    <string name="era0_info_detallada">On March 6, 1902, the Madrid Foot-Ball Club was officially founded under the presidency of Juan Padrós. In these early years, the club began to stand out in the Regional Championship and won its first Spanish Cups. In 1920, King Alfonso XIII granted it the title of \'Real\', thus giving birth to the name we know today. It was an era of pioneers who played on pitches like O\'Donnell or the Velodrome, laying the foundations for the white ambition.</string>

    <string name="era1_titulo">Don Santiago Bernabéu</string>
    <string name="era1_periodo">1940 - 1953</string>
    <string name="era1_info_corta">Santiago Bernabéu becomes the club president</string>
    <string name="era1_info_detallada">In 1943, Santiago Bernabéu assumed the presidency at one of the most critical moments after the post-war period. His vision was revolutionary: he understood that to be the greatest, they needed the best setting, promoting the construction of the new stadium (opened in 1947). Bernabéu not only rebuilt the facilities but also professionalized the institution and sowed the values of nobility and ambition that today form Real Madrid\'s DNA.</string>

    <string name="era2_titulo">Di Stéfano\'s Madrid</string>
    <string name="era2_periodo">1953 - 1963</string>
    <string name="era2_info_corta">The 5 European Cups in a row.</string>
    <string name="era2_info_detallada">The arrival of Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1953 marked a before and after in football history. Together with legends like Puskas, Gento, Kopa, and Santamaría, Real Madrid became the dominant force on the continent. They consecutively won the first five European Cups (1956-1960), a feat never repeated. The team was admired for its attacking play and elegance, being recognized worldwide as the best team of the era.</string>

    <string name="era3_titulo">The Yé-yé Madrid</string>
    <string name="era3_periodo">1963 - 1980</string>
    <string name="era3_info_corta">Total dominance in Spain.</string>
    <string name="era3_info_detallada">After the retirement of the great legends, the club reinvented itself with a team made up entirely of Spanish players, known as \'The Yé-yés\'. Led by veteran Paco Gento, they managed to win the Sixth European Cup in 1966 in Brussels. During the 70s, the team maintained its dominance in Spain by winning multiple leagues and cups, consolidating the club\'s mystique and the legend of players like Pirri, Amancio, or Santillana.</string>

    <string name="era4_titulo">Vulture\'s Cohort</string>
    <string name="era4_periodo">1980 - 1990</string>
    <string name="era4_info_corta">Five consecutive league titles.</string>
    <string name="era4_info_detallada">In the early 80s, a generation of footballers emerged from the youth system that would change the club\'s style: The Quinta del Buitre. Formed by Butragueño, Míchel, Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, and Pardeza, this team made the Bernabéu fall in love with its technical and associative football. They achieved the milestone of winning five consecutive Leagues (1986-1990) and two UEFA Cups, marking a decade of total football in Spain, although the European Cup cruelly resisted them.</string>

    <string name="era5_titulo">From the Seventh to the Ninth</string>
    <string name="era5_periodo">1990 - 2003</string>
    <string name="era5_info_corta">Return to European success</string>
    <string name="era5_info_detallada">The 90s brought the long-awaited return to European glory. In 1998, Real Madrid won \'The Seventh\' in Amsterdam thanks to Pedja Mijatovic\'s unforgettable goal, breaking a 32-year drought. It was the start of a new golden era where the Eighth (2000) in the first-ever all-Spanish final, and the Ninth (2002) with Zidane\'s masterful volley in Glasgow during the Centenary year, would soon arrive.</string>

    <string name="era6_titulo">The Galacticos</string>
    <string name="era6_periodo">2000 - 2010</string>
    <string name="era6_info_corta">Zidane, Ronaldo and the Centenary.</string>
    <string name="era6_info_detallada">With the turn of the new millennium, Florentino Pérez promoted a model based on gathering the best players on the planet. The club signed stars like Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, and Beckham, creating the team known as \'The Galacticos\'. Beyond the titles, the club experienced unprecedented global expansion and was recognized by FIFA as the Best Club of the 20th Century, elevating the Real Madrid brand to a worldwide level.</string>

    <string name="era7_titulo">Cristiano Ronaldo. The Beast</string>
    <string name="era7_periodo">2009 - 2018</string>
    <string name="era7_info_corta">The Portuguese star arrives at the Castellana.</string>
    <string name="era7_info_detallada">In 2009, one of the most successful cycles in modern history began. Cristiano Ronaldo arrived at the club to become its all-time top scorer. Under the direction of coaches like Mourinho, Ancelotti, and Zidane, the historical milestone of winning four Champions Leagues in five years was achieved, including three of them consecutively (2016-2018). It was the era of \'The Tenth\', impossible comebacks, and absolute European dominance.</string>

    <string name="era8_titulo">The New Era</string>
    <string name="era8_periodo">2019 - Today</string>
    <string name="era8_info_corta">Rebuilding modern Madrid</string>
    <string name="era8_info_detallada">Current Real Madrid faces the future with the remodeling of the Santiago Bernabéu, destined to be the best stadium in the world. Sportingly, the club has managed an exemplary transition by joining legendary veterans like Modric or Kroos with young stars like Vinícius Jr, Bellingham, or Rodrygo. In 2022, the 14th Champions was achieved with one of the most epic editions remembered, and in 2024, the 15th, confirming that the club\'s ambition knows no limits.</string>
